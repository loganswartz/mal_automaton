"""
The key differences between this memento_factory() and the one from the
"mementos" package are:
    * The class being memoized is automatically included in the memo cache key,
    instead of needing to be including explicitly.
    * You can choose whether to initialize the object with just the memo cache
    key, or with all the arguments the class was originally called with.
